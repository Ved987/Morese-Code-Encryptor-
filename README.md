# Morse-Code-Encryptor-
Hey guys. Everyone knows and loves the thrill of using the morse code language for secure communications in the art of war. 
In the digital era, we can use this technique to encrypt data. but just using the basic morse code can be deciphered easily.
Hence in order to increase its security I decided to create a multi level encryption algo which starts of with using a mathematical equation to perform encryption,
then the encrypted text is converted to morse code which on level three is again hidden in a plain text between the spaces and finally encrypted inside an Image using the LSB steganography techniques.

In order to run the code just clone the repo and run the main.py file.
